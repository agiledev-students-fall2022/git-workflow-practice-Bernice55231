### About this article:
Functional requirements are ususally the most important thing that software developers consider as since they define what a system is supposed to do. However, non-functional requirements are also important since they stipulate how a system supposed to be. This article introduces the top 10 Architecture Characteristics in details that developers should emphasize on. The top 10 characteristics are scalability, security, availability, extensibility, consistency, resiliency, usability, observability, security, durability and agility. By considering all the aspects, we software developers could identify the bottleneck or less performing area which are potential start point to improve the overall reliability of the system.

### Elaine Shan's comment:
When designing the software architecture, we need to consider both the functional and nunfunctional requirement. This article is very useful to the software engineers because it provides a list of software architecture charactersitcs that may be essential for software developers to consider.
